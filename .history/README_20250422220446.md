# E-Portfolio

A responsive personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and experience.

## Project Overview

This portfolio is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a future plan to migrate to React for enhanced functionality and component reusability. Currently structured for my ENGL 202C Assignment, with plans to strengthen functionality in the future.
